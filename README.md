Tools for tracking down memory / JVM problems &amp; generating predictable-as-possible VM behaviour 

The first tool uses a probability distribution to determine when an object should be deleted from a cache.

This enables decent control of the memory profile and garbage collection dynamics of the app

At least, that's the theory.
